# Cancer Detection - Machine Learning and Deep_Learning Approach
Analysis of Histopathological Slides for Cancer Detection using Machine Learning and Deep_Learning 

#OVERVIEW
Cancer is a deadly disease. Researchers and clinicians are trying to find the methods to detect it at
early stages. Early diagnosis will play an important role in planning the treatment plan and
improvement of the patientâ€™s survival rate. Cancer can be benign (localized) or metastatic (spread to
distant organs). One of the most important early diagnosis is detection in lymph nodes to find out
whether the cancer has metastasized or not. The method to do this is H & E staining of histological
slides of lymph nodes taken from biopsies.

#GOAL
Currently pathologists manually examine the slides in the laboratory and decide if the patient has
metastatic cancer or not. Reading the slides and making a report based on human judgement which
can be inconsistent and vary from person to person and from day to day. Therefore, developing a
computation model to read the slides would provide and can automate the process to give unbiased
results.
